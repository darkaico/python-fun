# Python for Fun

Playing with python.

Package control using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

In most of the cases I'm using [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook) to show examples.

## Installation and Start

```bash
$ poetry install
$ make start
```

## Examples

- Sierpinski Fractal
